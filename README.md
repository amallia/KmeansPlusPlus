# KmeansPlusPlus
k-means++: a C++ version implement
k-means++ clustering a classification of data, so that points assigned to the same cluster are similar. 
It is identical to the K-means algorithm, except for the selection of initial conditions. 
I implement k-means++ clustering algorithm by using C++. The implemented open source code can be used freely. 
If you have any questions , please conected y.j.zhou.g@gmail.com. The implemented code including the following features. 

Features

Standard k-means clustering methed
Standard k-means clustering methed with parallel acceleratation
k-means++ clustering methed
k-means++ clustering methed with parallel acceleratation
Export the result as SVG format
Export the result as EPS format
